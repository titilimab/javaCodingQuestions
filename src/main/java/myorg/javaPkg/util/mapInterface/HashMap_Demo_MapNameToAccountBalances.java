		Set<Entry<String, Double>> java.util.HashMap.entrySet()
		
		public Set<Map.Entry<K,V>> entrySet()

		Returns a Set view of the mappings contained in this map.The set is backed by the map, so changes to the map are reflected in the set, and vice-versa. 
		If the map is modified while an iteration over the set is in progress (except through the iterator's own remove operation, or through the setValue operation on a map entry returned by the iterator) the results of the iteration are undefined. 
		The set supports element removal, which removes the corresponding mapping from the map, via the Iterator.remove, Set.remove, removeAll, retainAll and clear operations. 
		It does not support the add or addAll operations.

		**** All about Map.Entry
		java.util.Map.Entry<String, Double>
		
		A map entry (key-value pair). 
		The Map.entrySet method returns a collection-view(collection view means view in the form of any collection of java.util.Collection Interface) of the map in the form of a set, whose elements are of this class. 
		The only way to obtain a reference to a map entry is from the iterator of this collection-view. 
		These Map.Entry objects are valid only for the duration of the iteration; 
		more formally,the behavior of a map entry is undefined if the backing map has been modified after the entry was returned by the iterator, except through the setValue operation on the map entry.
